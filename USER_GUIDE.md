# User guide 2.+

## Applying the Plugin
For both _`appengine-web.xml`_ and _`app.yaml`_ based applications, include the plugin in your pom.xml:

```XML
...
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
      <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>VERSION</version>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

The [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) is required for this plugin to
function. Download and install it before running any tasks.

As of version 2.0.0, App Engine goals no longer fork. In order to run any App Engine goals, you must
make sure to package your application first (i.e. run `mvn package appengine:<goal>`). You may also
bind the goals to a lifecycle phase in your pom.xml.

## App Engine `appengine-web.xml` based projects
The plugin will choose the build path for `appengine-web.xml` based projects if you include an `appengine-web.xml`
in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/`, otherwise it will assume it is an [`app.yaml` based project](#app-engine-app.yaml-based-project)
application.

### Goals
For appengine-web.xml based projects the plugin exposes the following goals :

#### Local Run

| Goal              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `run`             | Run the application locally. |
| `start`           | Start the application in the background. |
| `stop`            | Stop a running application. |


#### Deployment

| Goal             | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `cloudSdkLogin`  | Login and set the Cloud SDK common configuration user. |
| `stage`          | Stage an application for deployment. |
| `deploy`         | Deploy an application. |
| `deployCron`     | Deploy cron configuration. |
| `deployDispatch` | Deploy dispatch configuration. |
| `deployDos`      | Deploy dos configuration. |
| `deployIndex`    | Deploy datastore index configuration. |
| `deployQueue`    | Deploy queue configuration. |
| `deployAll`      | Deploy the application and all of its configuration files at once. |

### Configuration
Once you've [initialized](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) `gcloud` you can run and deploy
your application using the defaults provided by the plugin.

To see the generated documentation for goals and parameters including default values, execute the
following:

```bash
$  mvn appengine:help -Ddetail
```

If you wish to customize your configuration, the plugin can be configured using the usual
`<configuration>` element.

## FAQ

### How do I deploy my project Configuration Files?

You can now deploy the cron/dos/etc. configuration files separately using the new goals:

* `deployCron`
* `deployDispatch`
* `deployDos`
* `deployIndex`
* `deployQueue`

You may also use the `deployAll` goal to deploy the application and all valid configuration files at once.

For `app.yaml` based projects, the deployment source directory can be overridden by setting the `appEngineDirectory`
parameter in the deploy configuration.

For `appengine-web.xml` based projects, it defaults to `<stagingDirectory>/WEB-INF/appengine-generated`
(and `stagingDirectory` defaults to `${project.build.directory}/appengine-staging`).
You should not change this configuration; this is the location that your
xml configs are converted into yaml for deployment.

### How do I debug Dev Appserver v1?

You can debug the Dev App Server v1 using the jvmFlags:

```XML
<configuration>
  <jvmFlags>
    <jvmFlag>
        -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=n
    </jvmFlag>
  </jvmFlags>
</configuration>
```

### How do I enable automatic reload of my application?

To enable automatic reload of an application, you must tell the Dev App Server to scan for changes :
```XML
<configuration>
  <automaticRestart>true</automaticRestart>
</configuration>
```
While your app is running, just run `mvn war:exploded` to reflect your changes into the running application.


### How do I put datastore somewhere else (so it's not deleted across rebuilds)?

```XML
<configuration>
  <jvmFlags>
    <jvmFlag>
        -Ddatastore.backing_store=/path/to/my/local_db.bin
    </jvmFlag>
  </jvmFlags>
</configuration>
```

### How do I run multiple modules on the Dev App Server v1?

Multimodule support can be done by adding all the runnable modules to a single module's configuration (which currently must be an appengine-web.xml based application).

```XML
<configuration>
  <services>
    <service>${project.build.directory}/${project.name}-${project.version}</service>
    <service>${project.parent.basedir}/other_module/target/other_module_finalName-${project.version}</service>
  </services>
</configuration>
```

### I want to use Dev Appserver 2 (alpha), how do I switch to it?

The v2-alpha Dev Appserver is no longer supported from this plugin.

### How can I pass environment variables to the Dev Appserver?

You can pass environment variables directly to the Dev App Server:

```XML
<configuration>
  <environment>
    <VARIABLE_NAME>value</VARIABLE_NAME>
  </environment>
</configuration>
```

### How can I pass additional arguments to the Dev Appserver?

You can pass additional arguments directly to the Dev App Server:

```XML
<configuration>
  <additionalArguments>
    <additionalArgument>--ARG1</additionalArgument>
    <additionalArgument>--ARG2</additionalArgument>
  </additionalArguments>
</configuration>
```

### How can I bind App Engine goals to lifecycle phases in my build file?

You can add something like the following to your pom.xml:

```XML
<plugin>
  ...
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>deploy</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>deploy</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  ...
</plugin>
```

In this case, running `mvn deploy` will automatically build and deploy the application to appengine.

### I have a project that has both `app.yaml` and `appengine-web.xml` based config. How do I control which deployment to use?

The plugin defaults to `appengine-web.xml` based deployment if your project contains a `webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml`
file. If your project also has an `src/main/appengine/app.yaml` file and you wish to use that, you may temporarily move the
`appengine-web.xml` file to a different location before deploying.

### How do I deploy other files with my application to App Engine?

When configuring an `app.yaml` based project, the `extraFilesDirectories` configuration option lets
you configure locations on your local drive of files that will be deployed with your application.

```xml
<configuration>
  <extraFilesDirectories>
    <extraFilesDirectory>path/to/my/extras</extraFilesDirectory>
  </extraFilesDirectories>
</configuration>
```

Then when you run `mvn package appengine:deploy` the contents of `path/to/my/extras` are staged with you application and included as part of the deployment.
