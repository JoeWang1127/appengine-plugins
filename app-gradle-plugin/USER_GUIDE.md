# User Guide 2.+

## Applying the Plugin
Apply the plugin following the instructions in [README.md](README.md#how-to-use) and using the appropriate plugin identifier:
1. `"com.google.cloud.tools.appengine-appenginewebxml"` for [war projects defined by an `appengine-web.xml`](#app-engine-appengine-webxml-based-projects)
1. `"com.google.cloud.tools.appengine-appyaml"` for [projects defined by an `app.yaml`](#app-engine-appyaml-based-projects)
1. `"com.google.cloud.tools.appengine"` for automatic environment determination (not recommended)


When you use the `com.google.cloud.tools.appengine` plugin it will automatically determine
your environment based on the presence of an `appengine-web.xml`
in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/`. It will enable _`appengine-appenginewebxml`_ if present, _`appengine-appyaml`_ otherwise.
Note: autodetection will not work if you set a custom [`webAppDirName` property](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/war_plugin.html#sec:war_convention_properties) of the `war` plugin.
In this case, manually apply the right environment-specific plugin by specifying the corresponding plugin identifier as above.

The [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) will be downloaded automatically, unless `cloudSdkHome` property is provided (see [tools section](#tools) below).

### Configuration
Once you've [initialized](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) `gcloud` you can run and deploy
your application using the defaults provided by the plugin. To view the default configuration values, run :

```
$ ./gradlew appengineShowConfiguration
```

If you wish to customize the plugin further, the plugin can be configured using the `appengine`
configuration closure.

```groovy
appengine {
  tools {
    // configure the Cloud Sdk tooling
  }
  run {
    // configure local run
  }
  stage {
    // configure staging for deployment
  }
  deploy {

  }
}
```

##### Tools

on OSX, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%/google/ct4j-cloud-sdk/<version>/google-cloud-sdk` on Windows.

### How do I deploy my project Configuration Files?

You can now deploy index.yaml/dos.yaml/etc for all environments.

Use the following tasks :
* `appengineDeployCron`
* `appengineDeployDispatch`
* `appengineDeployDos`
* `appengineDeployIndex`
* `appengineDeployQueue`

The deployment source directory can be overridden by setting the `appEngineDirectory` parameter
in the deploy configuration.

For appengine-web.xml based projects, it defaults to `${buildDir}/staged-app/WEB-INF/appengine-generated`.
You should not change this configuration; this is the location that your xml configs are converted
into yaml for deployment.

```groovy
appengine {
  deploy {
    appEngineDirectory = "my/custom/appengine/project/configuration/directory"
  }
}
```

### How do I debug Dev Appserver v1?

You can debug the Dev App Server v1 using the jvmFlags :

```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    jvmFlags = ["-Xdebug", "-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"]
  }
}
```

### How do I enable automatic reload of my application?

To enable automatic reload of your application:
1. You must tell the Dev App Server v1 to scan for changes :
    ```groovy
    appengine {
      run {
        automaticRestart = true
      }
    }
    ```
2. While your app is running, just run `explodeWar` to copy the changes into the exploded app directly and reflect your changes into the running application.

If you wish to try gradle's experimental `--continuous` for automatic change application, see [#174](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin/issues/174).

### How do I put datastore somewhere else (so it's not deleted across rebuilds)?
```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    jvmFlags = ["-Ddatastore.backing_store=/path/to/my/local_db.bin"]
  }
}
```

### How do I run multiple modules on the Dev App Server v1?

Multimodule support can be done by adding all the runnable modules to a single runner's configuration (which currently
must be an appengine-web.xml based application), and using a helper method to tie everything together.
```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    // configure the app to point to the right service directories
    services = [
        projectAsService(project),
        projectAsService(":another-module")
    ]
  }
}
```

### I want to use Dev Appserver 2 (alpha), how do I switch to it?

The v2-alpha Dev Appserver is no longer supported from this plugin.
