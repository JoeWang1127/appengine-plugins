# User Guide 1.+

## Applying the Plugin
Include the plugin jar in your buildscript classpath and apply the appropriate Standard or Flexible plugin:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.google.cloud.tools:appengine-gradle-plugin:<version>"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.google.cloud.tools.appengine-standard"
// or
apply plugin: "com.google.cloud.tools.appengine-flexible"
```

You can also use the `com.google.cloud.tools.appengine` plugin that will automatically determine
your environment based on the presence of an `appengine-web.xml`
in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/`, _Standard_ if present, _Flexible_ otherwise.

The [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) is required for this plugin to
function. Download and install it before running any tasks.

### How do I deploy my project Configuration Files?

You can now deploy index.yaml/dos.yaml/etc without configuring deployables for
both flexible and standard environments.

Use the following tasks :
* `appengineDeployCron`
* `appengineDeployDispatch`
* `appengineDeployDos`
* `appengineDeployIndex`
* `appengineDeployQueue`

The deployment source directory can be overridden by setting the `appEngineDirectory` parameter
in the deploy configuration.

For standard it defaults to `${buildDir}/staged-app/WEB-INF/appengine-generated`, you should probably
not change this configuration, for standard configured projects, this is the location that your
xml configs are converted into yaml for deployment.

```groovy
appengine {
  deploy {
    appEngineDirectory = "my/custom/appengine/project/configuration/directory"
  }
}
```

### How do I debug Dev Appserver v1?

You can debug the Dev App Server v1 using the jvmFlags :

```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    jvmFlags = ["-Xdebug", "-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"]
  }
}
```

### How do I enable hot reload of my application?

To enable hot reload of classes:
1. You must tell the Dev App Server v1 to scan for changes :
    ```groovy
    appengine {
      run {
        jvmFlags = ["-Dappengine.fullscan.seconds=5"]
      }
    }
    ```
2. While your app is running, just run `explodeWar` to copy the changes into the exploded app directly and reflect your changes into the running application.

If you wish to try gradle's experimental `--continuous` for automatic change application, see [#174](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin/issues/174).

### How do I put datastore somewhere else (so it's not deleted across rebuilds)?
```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    jvmFlags = ["-Ddatastore.backing_store=/path/to/my/local_db.bin"]
  }
}
```

### How do I run multiple modules on the Dev App Server v1?

Multimodule support can be done by adding all the runnable modules to a single runner's configuration (which currently
must be an appengine-standard application), and using a helper method to tie everything together.
```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    // configure the app to point to the right service directories
    services = [
        getExplodedAppDir(project),
        getExplodedAppDir(project(":another-module"))
    ]
  }
}

// helper method to obtain correct directory and set up dependencies
def getExplodedAppDir(Project p) {
  // if not 'this' module, then do some setup.
  if (p != project) {
    // make sure we evaluate other modules first so we get the right value
    evaluationDependsOn(p.path)
    // make sure we build "run" depends on the other modules exploding wars
    project.tasks.appengineRun.dependsOn p.tasks.explodeWar
  }
  return p.tasks.explodeWar.explodedAppDirectory
}
```

### I want to use Dev Appserver 2 (alpha), how do I switch to it?

To switch back to the Dev App Server v2-alpha (that was default in version < 1.3.0) use the `serverVersion` parameter

```
appengine {
  run {
    serverVersion = "2-alpha"
  }
}
```
